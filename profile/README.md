TestDriver isn't like any test framework you've used before - it's more like your own QA employee with their own development environment. 

TestDriver uses AI to understand what's on the screen, move the mouse and operate the keyboard. This kind of black-box testing has some major advantages:

- **Easier set up:** No need to add test IDs or craft complex selectors
- **Less Maintenance:** Tests don't break when code changes
- **More Power:** TestDriver can test any application and control any OS setting
